Concepts:
Data is essential. It is what you do with the data

Objectives:
Importance of data in a digital world
Unstructred vs Structured data
Purpose of a database
Quantitative vs Qualitative data
The big V's of data
Four types of data analytics
work involved in each step of the data analysis process
identify the purpose of data visualization
recognize different charts oto display data visualizations in the best way


Data Insights:
Improve operations
better understand end users or customers
drive efficiency
reduce costs
increase profits
find new innovations

Data life saver: find insight to data tha can help solve global challenges, like poverty, climate change, diseases, inequality and terrorism

Data is a problem solver: To make sense of data, analysts follow a process to gather, cleanse, and transform data
What is the data teling us?

2.5 quintillion is the data produced by the world evrey day
The amount of data wil continue to grow as the world enters an even more data-driven future

Structured: Databases, Formatted files --> it can be organised in rows and columns
Unstructured: audio, video, image data, documents --> has no predefined format

Database: It is an organized collection of structured data in a computer system
Relational databases: They are a collection of multiple datasets and tables that are linked together


Big data and its characteristics: 5 V's: Volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value

The four types of data analytics
Descriptive - what is happening
Diagnostic - why is it happening
Predictive - what is likely to happen in the future
Prescriptive - what should happen(combines the insight from all previous data to determine a course of action)



Data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, and transforming data to obtain insights to help make better and informed decisions.
Before a project, a good starting pioint is to have a business objective in mind and a clearly defined problem.
Steps: collect -> clean -> analyze -> visualize

ETL -> Extract, Transform and Load

Data Science - It is the understanding of the world through scientific analysis of digital data.
The goal is to extract value from data in all its forms

Data analysts collect and examine large data sets to identify trends, forecasts, and data visualizations to tell a compelling story through actionable insights. 
These insights help businesses make informed decisions about business needs.

Data scientists design and create new processes for data modeling. They use algorithms, predictive analytics, and statistical analysis. 
Data scientists have technical skills to arrange unstructured data and build their own methodologies to make predictions based on data trends.
