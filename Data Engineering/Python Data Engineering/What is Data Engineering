Building Data Pipelines - Extract, Transform, and Load

At the lowest level data engineers involves the movement of data from one system or 
format to another system or format.

When dealing with multiple databases, with different geographicaal locations - e,g retailers with 
different databases in different continents. 

How would you create connections to all of the transactional databases for each region, extract the data, and load it into a data warehouse. From there you can now count the item you want to know.
    We can find out which locations sell the most?
    Peak time for selling?
    How many users put the items in carts and remove them later?
    Combinations of items sold together?
