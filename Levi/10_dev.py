# tuples - it is a type of data structure, A cointainer to store multiple pieces of information
# tuples are better when you are iterating through a constant set of data. They are faster than lists and are write protect as they are immutable
coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)] # these are tuples in a list. the values can't be changed buyt you can add more tuples
print(coordinates[1])
# coordinates are good because they don't need to be changed
