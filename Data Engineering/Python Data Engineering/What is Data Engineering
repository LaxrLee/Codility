Building Data Pipelines - Extract, Transform, and Load

At the lowest level data engineers involves the movement of data from one system or 
format to another system or format.

When dealing with multiple databases, with different geographicaal locations - e,g retailers with 
different databases in different continents. 

How would you create connections to all of the transactional databases for each region, extract the data, and load it into a data warehouse. From there you can now count the item you want to know.
    We can find out which locations sell the most?
    Peak time for selling?
    How many users put the items in carts and remove them later?
    Combinations of items sold together?

It's more than just extracting data and loading it into a single system. 
We need to account for a bunch of things, such as timezones, we would need to transform the time fields to a standard.
We will also need to distinguish sales in each region. This could be accomplished by adding a new comlumn for location. Field should be spatial - in cordinates or as well-known text - or will just be text that could be transformed in a data engineering pipeline?

extract - transform - set the daata standards, for time, the international organization for standardization ISO 8601.
        Extract the data from each database
        add field to tag the location for each transaction in the data
        transfirm the date from local time to ISO 8601
        load the data into the data waregouse

This is accomplished by the creation of the data pipeline.
[source_data] --> [Extract] --> [Add_Location] --> [Transform_date] --> [Load] --> [Cleann_data]
